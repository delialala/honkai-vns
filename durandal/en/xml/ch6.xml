                <p class="article-text">此段文字翻译自阿兰·图灵（Alan Mathison Turing）于1950年发表的论文《计算机器与智能》（Computing Machinery and Intelligence）。</p>
                <p class="article-text">这里的“模仿游戏”（后世称之为“图灵测验”）是指：一个人（代号C）使用他和测试对象皆理解的语言，去询问两个他不能直接感知的对象（一台机器，代号A；一个思维正常的人，代号B）任意一串问题——如果经过足够长的问答后，C仍不能准确判断出A与B谁是机器、谁是人，则称此机器A赢得“模仿游戏”（即“通过图灵测验”）。</p>
                <p class="article-text">图灵测验的理论价值在于提出了一种切实可行的评判标准：如果一台机器能够稳定赢得“模仿游戏”，那么从客观的角度出发，这台机器在“心智能力”上和“人”就是没有区别的。</p>
