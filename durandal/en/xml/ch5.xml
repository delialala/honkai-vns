            <text>I am dreaming. A dream of when I still lived in a Russian orphanage.</text>
            <text>The city is called Sochi. It has a warm climate, and it's surrounded by mountains and facing the sea.</text>
            <text>I ran freely through the alleys, inhaling fresh air into my lungs. As I slowly exhale I feel like I was able to get out something melancholic within me.</text>
            <text>Cirsium bloomed in the weathered road under the lovely sunlight of June.</text>
            <text>They are purple, thorny, arrogant and stubborn flowers, able to grown freely in the most barren lands.</text>
            <text>Just like all the hardworking poor humans.</text>
            <text>Bees fly around the flowers. A familiar smell tickles my nose.</text>
            <text>I don't know where or when was this. It could all be a weird hallucination.</text>
            <text>But I know one thing for sure. There is something I've lost and is still missing, buried here like a time capsule.</text>
            <text>Walking past the steam of the hot springs, I arrive at the shore of the Black Sea.</text>
            <text remark="next">From the Argonauts to Nikolai Ostrovsky, countless known and unknown heroes have stopped here to listen to the sound of the waves.</text>

                <p class="article-text">尼古拉·阿列克谢耶维奇·奥斯特洛夫斯基（Николай Алексеевич Островский, 1904 - 1936）是一位传奇式的苏联作家。他15岁参军入伍，16岁时在战斗中头部负伤、右眼失明，23岁时全身瘫痪、双目失明；然而，就是在这种状况下，他坚持口述（由妻子整理）并在29岁时完成了一部讲述信念、毅力、自我认同的自传体小说——《钢铁是怎样炼成的》。</p>

            <speak chara="_guideLighthouse">The 「Great Library」 was once the personal museum of a previous ruler. Its origin can be traced back to an ancient temple. In the Year 2 of the Republic Calendar it was rebuilt as a scientific research institute.</speak>
            <speak chara="_guideLighthouse">The citizens of Alexandria believe science to be very important. For that reason the 「Great Library」 has been given the same social status as the 「Public Council」 and the 「City Administration Group」. Thanks to the widespread use of robots as public servants, the 「Great Library」 has taken over the duties of the 「courtroom」 and has become a pillar of society as a legal institution.</speak>
            <speak chara="_guideLighthouse">The external side of the building has been heavily influenced by Asian culture, but the interior remains Greek in style, similar to the 「City Hall」.</speak>
            <speak chara="_guideLighthouse">The interior and exterior belong to different cultures, but their nature matches so well it can be seen as a rare example of architectural transformation.</speak>
            <speak chara="_guideLighthouse">Use of the Great Library is free to those registered in the city. Outsiders must provide a citizen guarantee or make a payment in advance.</speak>
