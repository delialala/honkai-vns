            <speak chara="_Thoreau">And at the same time, there was an abnormal depletion of Honkai Energy in the center of the Anchor Point, where we are now - It appears to be a rare case of “Anchor Capillary Blockage”.</speak>

            <show chara="yukimuraColdClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_Yukimura">However, the depletion of Honkai Energy means that it’s likely there is a group of capillary channels connecting the island and the Anchor Point center.</speak>

            <speak chara="_OttoDr">Oh, it seems you don’t know this story.</speak>
            <show chara="ottoDrKindClose" position="back"/>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">Putting it in simple terms, a magical princess fell in love with a prince who was a captain and helped him steal her country’s god-given treasure, the “Golden Fleece”. The prince and the princess married on the ship later.</speak>
            <show chara="ottoDrTalkClose" position="back"/>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">--The real story starts after that.</speak>
            <show chara="ottoDrColdClose" position="back"/>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">On the way back to the prince’s country on the “Argo”, the princess’s younger brother chased them down to regain the stolen treasure.</speak>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">And for the sake of the prince, the princess killed her brother without mercy.</speak>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">The prince returned to his home country with the Golden Fleece, but the usurper who promised to return the throne if he succeeded turned back on his word.</speak>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">The princess then used her specialty, magic, and tricked the usurper to enter a “Magical pot of rejuvenation”, causing him to die in the boiling water.</speak>
            <show chara="ottoDrTalkClose" position="back"/>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">The princess did so much for the prince, but he ended up leaving her out of fear.</speak>
            <show chara="ottoDrColdClose" position="back"/>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">In his eyes, the princess’s blood stained hands resembled that of a devil’s.</speak>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">In fact, the prince didn’t even expect his adventure to succeed - But when the princess did all of that for him without worrying about the cost, he felt panic, fear and even disgust.</speak>
            <show chara="ottoDrTalkClose" position="back"/>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">But was the princess really in the wrong?</speak>
            <show chara="ottoDrColdClose" position="back"/>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">A poison named “Love” had taken her soul, and all she could do was give her all to support the one she loved--</speak>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">--Even if she stains her hands with blood, even if she becomes an enemy of the world.</speak>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">Once love captured her soul… her life was destined to become a tragedy.</speak>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">...Of course, she is still happier than the vermin whose life-long love would never be reciprocated.</speak>
            <show chara="ottoDrTalkClose" position="back"/>
            <speak chara="_OttoDr">But in the end, she still killed her only proof of happiness - Her and the prince’s two children.</speak>
            <speak chara="_Bianka">……</speak>
            <speak chara="_Bianka">That’s a really scary fairy tale. Why did you want to tell it to me?</speak>

            <show chara="ottoDrTrickyClose" position="back"/>
