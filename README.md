# Honkai VNs

Continuation of Chinese-to-English translation work of Honkai Impact VNs, from https://github.com/zklm/honkai-vns, in the form of edits to .xml files that can be loaded via zklm's scripts into the VN viewer.



## Standalone viewers

The standalone VN viewers made by zklm are available below:

- **Anti-Entropy:** https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-antientropy/ (Standalone)
- **Durandal:** https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-durandal/ (Standalone)
- **Seven Swords:** https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-sevenswords/ (Standalone)
  - Note: does not currently have UI settings that allow toggling between languages - so it is largely useless for translations. Perhaps someone with the relevant coding experience can look into enabling this.

### How to use - for readers

1. Go to https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-antientropy/

### How to use - for translators

1. Create a fork of my  `main` branch.
2. Do your edits in the relevant .xml documents.

If you have any questions feel free to message delialala#8801 in discord or catch me in lore chat on the official Honkai discord server. I won't merge with listless-restless' repostitory just yet because we haven't finished working on the Durandal vn.


### Known issues

- **Multi-line scrolling not available:** Multi-line scrolling in the dialog boxes is not working in the standalone VN viewers (e.g. https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-antientropy/) as it does in Mihoyo's original viewer (https://event.bh3.com/avgAntiEntropy/indexAntiEntropy.php). This is the case for both Chinese and translated text. I do not have experience in Javascript, nor do I have access to the code that allows loading of Mihoyo and custom resources into a standalone viewer. So I cannot remedy this.
    - **Temporary solution:** For now, people who want to read all the text should go to the "Log", or at least set font size in the settings to the smallest possible value.
